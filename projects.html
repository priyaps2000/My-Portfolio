                <h2>Little Ones Bookhub Website</h2>
                <p>Five of us joined in a hacakthon conducted by <a href="https://twitter.com/renzil">Renzil D'souza</a> to build this website using HTML, CSS and Javascript. It's for Kishori- The owner of a Children's book library, Little Ones Bookhub based on Bangalore. All the book thumbnails collection were automated through web scraping. Have a look at <a href="https://littleonesbookhub.netlify.app/">what we've built </a>and <a href="https://github.com/littleonesbookhub/littleonesbookhub">the source code</a>.<br><br> We had a great guide/coordinator and this is the first time that I collaborated with teammates outside India! <br><br> Why wait? Explore some books for your loved ones at Bangalore! </p>

                <h2>Efficient Activity Recognition Using Wi-Fi CSI</h2>
                <p>Have you ever thought that a Broadcom WiFi chip could recognize what you are doing inside a room using WiFi signals from your home router? <br><br> Yes!, It doesnt require any wearables, sensors or camera. We apply machine learning techniques on channel state information(CSI) from WiFi signals to identify human gestures.</p>
