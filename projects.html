                <h2>Gen  AI Chatbot for ESG Benachmarking Automation<span class="period"><br>(MAR 2024)</span></h2>
                <p>
                    This project was developed as part of a hackathon, with the goal of automating the manual process of ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) benchmarking using Generative AI.
                     Our solution aimed to automate collection of metrics such as carbon footprint, diversity, and inclusion etc. from ESG reports of companies and trusted websites providing ESG ratings.
                     <br><br>
                     We designed a conversational AI chatbot capable of interacting with users to gather input PDFs and generate detailed ESG reports. 
                     The chatbot was powered by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, leveraging OpenAI GPT-3.5, LangChain models, Chroma DB and FastAPI.
                      We utilized Selenium and Beautiful Soup for web scraping 
                      to retrieve ESG metrics from websites. 
                      Additionally, we developed a feature to generate user-friendly, formatted PDF reports summarizing ESG metrics. 
                      These reports were securely stored and shared via Azure Blob Storage.
                      To provide a seamless user experience, we built a responsive web interface using Chainlit.The solution was hosted in Azure cloud.
                      <br><br>
                      We won first place in the hackathon by delivering a fully functional prototype within two days, 
                      showcasing the ability to rapidly build and deploy an impactful solution.

                <h2>Cosumer Finance Management Web App <span class="period"><br>(OCT 2022)</span></h2>
                <p>Being absolutely new to Java, Spring, SQL and React, we have built this web application in a very short span of less than a week. Itâ€™s not highly optimized for code practices or performance, but I haven't learned this much information in such a short span ever before in my life. We had a great time of collaboration and teamwork during the training days of my first-ever job. <br><br>Have a look at <a href="https://github.com/priyaps2000/consumerfinancemanagement">the source code.</a></p>

                <p>Five of us joined in a hacakthon conducted by <a href="https://twitter.com/renzil">Renzil D'souza</a> to build this website using HTML, CSS and Javascript. It's for Kishori- The owner of a Children's book library, Little Ones Bookhub based in Bangalore. The book thumbnail collection was automated through web scraping.

                <h2>Efficient Activity Recognition Using Wi-Fi CSI<span class="period">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(AUG 2021-MAY 2022)</span></h2>
                <p>Have you ever thought that a Broadcom WiFi chip could recognize what you are doing inside a room using WiFi signals from your home router? <br><br> Yes! It doesn't require wearables, sensors, or cameras. We apply machine learning techniques on channel state information(CSI) from WiFi signals to identify human gestures.</p>
