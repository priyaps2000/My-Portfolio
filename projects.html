                <p>Five of us joined in a hacakthon conducted by <a href="https://twitter.com/renzil">Renzil D'souza</a> to build this website using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

                <h2>Efficient Activity Recognition Using Wi-Fi CSI<span class="period">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(AUG 2021-MAY 2022)</span></h2>
                <p>Have you ever thought that a Broadcom WiFi chip could recognize what you are doing inside a room using WiFi signals from your home router? <br><br> Yes! It doesn't require wearables, sensors, or cameras. We apply machine learning techniques on channel state information(CSI) from WiFi signals to identify human gestures.</p>
